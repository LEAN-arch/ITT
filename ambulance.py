    The research followed a comprehensive, multi-stage methodology to move from raw data to an actionable solution. Each step built upon the last, ensuring the final recommendations were robust and data-driven:
    
    1.  **Data Analysis & Filtering:** The process began by collecting and cleaning historical emergency call records (FRAP) and ambulance GPS logs. This crucial first step involved handling missing data, filtering inconsistencies, and creating a unified, reliable dataset.
    
    2.  **Travel Time Correction:** A machine learning model (Random Forest) was developed to predict the error between standard API travel times (OSRM) and actual ambulance travel times. This correction is the core novelty, making all subsequent calculations more realistic.
    
    3.  **Demand Clustering:** Historical emergency call locations were grouped using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The center of each cluster was identified as a "demand point," representing a statistical hotspot for incidents.
    
    4.  **Location Optimization:** Using the demand points and corrected travel times as inputs, an optimization model (Robust Double Standard Model - RDSM) was executed. This model determined the optimal strategic locations for ambulances to be stationed throughout the day to maximize the probability of covering any incident with at least two units within a critical time window.
    
    5.  **Web-Based Tool Design:** Finally, the entire pipeline was integrated into the design of a web-based decision-support tool, allowing dispatchers to interact with the findings and run simulations, as demonstrated by this dashboard.

        Instead of predicting the exact travel time (a regression problem), the thesis frames this as a **classification problem**, which is more robust. The goal is to predict which *category of error* a given trip will fall into.
        
        The final corrected time is calculated as:

        - $T_{API}$ is the initial time estimated by the OSRM routing API.
        - $\Delta_{Predicted}$ is the predicted time correction, determined by the classification model.
        
        #### 1. Defining the Error Classes
        Based on the historical data, all trips were categorized into one of three classes based on the API error ($T_{API} - T_{Real}$):
        - **MD (Medium Decrement):** Large overestimations by the API (e.g., API was > 7 minutes slower than reality).
        - **SD (Small Decrement):** Moderate overestimations by the API (e.g., API was 2-7 minutes slower).
        - **INCREMENT:** Small errors or underestimations (e.g., API was less than 2 minutes slower).
        
        #### 2. The Classification Model
        A Random Forest model ($f$) was trained to predict the class for a new trip based on a vector of input features ($X$):

        #### 3. Applying the Correction
        Once the model predicts a class, a pre-calculated correction value for that class is used. The thesis found that using the **median error** of all historical trips in a given class was a robust choice for $\Delta_{Predicted}$.
        
        - If `Predicted_Class` is **MD**, then $\Delta_{Predicted} = \text{Median Error of MD Class}$ (e.g., -8.5 minutes).
        - If `Predicted_Class` is **SD**, then $\Delta_{Predicted} = \text{Median Error of SD Class}$ (e.g., -3.7 minutes).
        
        This multi-step process makes the system highly effective, as it corrects the raw API estimates with a data-driven, context-aware prediction before feeding them into the final optimization model.

The vast majority of the bars are on the positive side of zero, indicating that the **API consistently overestimates the travel time**. This "optimism gap" occurs because the API calculates routes for regular traffic, while an ambulance with sirens can often bypass congestion, take more direct routes, and exceed normal speed limits. Relying on these uncorrected, overly pessimistic estimates leads to suboptimal placement of ambulances, as the system believes it takes longer to cover distances than it actually does.

This accuracy is the cornerstone of the subsequent location optimization, enabling the system to place ambulances more effectively and ultimately improve city-wide coverage by over 20%.
